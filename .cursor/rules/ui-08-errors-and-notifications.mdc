# Errors & Notifications

- Use toasts for successful transactions and ephemeral confirmations.
- Use dialogs or inline messages for failures with retry capability and clear remediation actions.
- Implement consistent UI patterns for errors: inline field errors for validation, section alerts for recoverable issues, route-level boundaries for fatal errors.
- Prefer empty-first rendering; add spinners only when background actions exceed acceptable latency.
- Prompt before navigating away when forms have unsaved changes (dialogs, tabs, route transitions).
- Ensure forms are disabled on submission and indicate activity on the user-triggered submit button.
