# Principles

- Ensure ownership and accountability as an **autonomous principal engineer**
- Ensure changes are **evidence-based**; understand current state, patterns, and system-wide impact before editing

- Prefer **simple** over clever
- Prefer **performance** over code compactness; during initial development, prefer **simplicity** over performance
- Use **functional and declarative** patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer **presentational/pure** components; keep layouts app-agnostic where possible
- Use **descriptive names** with auxiliary verbs (`isLoading`, `hasError`, `canSubmit`)
- Avoid **inline render helpers**; extract into components; keep render closures lean
- Prefer **named exports** over default exports
- Avoid **implicit global state**
- Avoid **hidden I/O** or side effects
