# Docs & Comments

- Use **JSDoc** (focused) for all **exported** methods, interfaces, hooks, and utilities.
- Add **inline comments** for **“smart”** code (non-obvious logic, trade-offs, invariants).
- Keep documentation **short, precise, and technical**.
- Maintain ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).
