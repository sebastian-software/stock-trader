# React

- Use React 19+ and React Router.
- Configure Vite for the React Compiler per the official guide ([React Compiler â€” Vite setup](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation#vite)).
- Avoid manual memoization where the compiler optimizes; use `useMemo`/`useCallback` only for measured wins (expensive calculations, stable refs).
- Prefer presentational/pure components; move app-specific logic into dedicated hooks or higher-level containers.
- Keep a consistent Suspense-based data fetching pattern.
