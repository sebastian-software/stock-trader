# Media & Icons

- Prefer **SVG** for icons and scalable graphics; avoid raster icons where possible
- Prefer modern image formats (**AVIF**, **WebP**) over legacy formats where supported
- Implement **responsive images** using `srcset`/`sizes` and leverage image CDNs with URL parameters for transforms (resize, quality, format)
- Icons must come from **Streamline** https://home.streamlinehq.com. Assume that we have a full access plan.
