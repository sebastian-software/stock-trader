# Media & Icons

- Prefer **SVG** for icons and scalable graphics; avoid raster icons where possible.
- Prefer modern image formats (**AVIF**, **WebP**) over legacy formats where supported.
- Implement responsive images using `srcset`/`sizes` and leverage image CDNs with URL parameters for transforms (resize, quality, format).
- Use icons from **Streamline** ([streamlinehq.com](https://home.streamlinehq.com)); assume full plan access.
