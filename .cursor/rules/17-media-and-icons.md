# Media & Icons

- Prefer modern image formats (**AVIF**, **WebP**) over legacy formats where supported
- Implement **responsive images** using `srcset`/`sizes` and leverage image CDNs with URL parameters for transforms (resize, quality, format)
- Prefer **SVG** for icons and scalable graphics; avoid raster icons where possible
- Use **Streamline** icons across applications; pick a single initial style and remain consistent
