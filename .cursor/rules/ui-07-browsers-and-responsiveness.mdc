# Browsers & Responsiveness

- Support the latest stable versions of Chrome, Edge, and Safari (desktop and mobile).
- Define `browserslist`: `>1% in GB, >1% in DE, >1% in FR, >1% in US, >1% in CA, not dead`.
- Build mobile- and desktop-friendly layouts; verify core flows on touch and pointer devices.
- Use responsive typography and layout grids; prefer CSS container queries where appropriate.
- Avoid polyfills unless essential for the supported matrix; measure impact before adding.
