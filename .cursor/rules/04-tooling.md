# Tooling & Build

- **Prettier** for formatting.
- **OXC** (https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) for linting with **recommended rules** enabled.
- **Vite** as the bundler; use the **Rolldown** backend for higher performance.
- **Vitest** for unit tests.
- **TypeScript path aliases** integrated with Vite (e.g., `vite-tsconfig-paths`).
- Pre-commit hooks with lint-staged for formatting/lint.
