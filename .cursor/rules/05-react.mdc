# React

- Use the **latest React** and **React Router**
- Use the **React Compiler**; avoid manual memoization where the compiler optimizes; use `useMemo`/`useCallback` only for measured wins (expensive calculations, stable refs)
- Prefer **presentational/pure** components; move app-specific logic into dedicated hooks or higher-level containers
- Keep a **consistent Suspense-based data fetching** pattern
