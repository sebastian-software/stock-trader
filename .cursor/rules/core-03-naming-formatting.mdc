# Naming & Formatting

- Use `lower-kebab-case` for directory names.
- Use `PascalCase` for component names.
- Use `camelCase` for hooks, utilities, and other modules (hooks start with `use...`).
- Use `PascalCase` for types and interfaces.
- Prefer named exports over default exports.
- Use US English for file names, source code, and default messages.
- Enforce 2-space indentation, double quotes, and semicolons via Prettier.
- Use standardized suffixes: `*.test.ts(x)`, `*.stories.tsx`, `*.css.ts`.
- Use Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`).
- Structure `.gitignore` with logical groupings: use section headers with clear categories (Dependencies, Frontend Build & Generated Files, Environment & Configuration, Development Tools, OS Files); include descriptive comments for each entry; organize entries from most common to least common within each section.
