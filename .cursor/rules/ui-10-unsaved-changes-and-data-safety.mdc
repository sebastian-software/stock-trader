# Unsaved Changes & Data Safety

- Implement **explicit Save/Cancel** flows; do not autosave form edits
- Show **confirmation prompts** when closing dialogs/tabs or navigating away with unsaved changes
- Preserve **in-flight user input** across refetches; merge server updates without overwriting local edits
- Use **controlled form state** modules/utilities to centralize dirty-tracking and navigation guards

See also: `ui-07-components-and-ui.mdc` references this policy to keep UI guidance aligned.
