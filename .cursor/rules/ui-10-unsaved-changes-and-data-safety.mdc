# Unsaved Changes & Data Safety

- Implement explicit **Save/Cancel** flows; do not autosave form edits.
- Show confirmation prompts when closing dialogs or tabs, or when navigating away with unsaved changes.
- Preserve in-flight user input across refetches; merge server updates without overwriting local edits.
- Use controlled form state modules and utilities to centralize dirty tracking and navigation guards.
