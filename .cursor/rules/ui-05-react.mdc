# React

- Use **React 19+** and **React Router Framework Mode**
- Use the **React Compiler** and configure Vite to run the compiler Babel plugin as documented in the official guide for Vite ([React Compiler â€” Vite setup](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation#vite))
- Avoid manual memoization where the compiler optimizes; use `useMemo`/`useCallback` only for measured wins (expensive calculations, stable refs)
- Prefer **presentational/pure** components; move app-specific logic into dedicated hooks or higher-level containers
- Keep a **consistent Suspense-based data fetching** pattern
