# Components & UI

- Use **Web Components** from `https://webawesome.com/` for core components
- Prefer these over plain native elements when they provide better styling or integration
- Wrap customized Web Components in **React wrappers** (typed props, event mapping, controlled/uncontrolled behavior)
- Write **presentational/pure** components: no App Context dependencies; use only app-free hooks (no global state, no app logic/data)
- Provide **Storybook stories** for all presentational/pure components (each pure component must have a story)
- Use **design tokens** with **Vanilla Extract** to keep theme styles out of implementation
- Adhere to the **Unsaved Changes & Data Safety** policy (`19-unsaved-changes-and-data-safety.mdc`)
- Avoid adding **margins** to reusable components; prefer container-controlled spacing patterns (e.g., self-controlled gaps [Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/article/self-gap/) or spacer components [Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/modern-spacer-gif/))
- Do not use icon sets bundled with Web Components; icons must come from **Streamline**
