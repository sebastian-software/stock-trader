# Project Rules â€” Index

These rules are split by topic. Cursor should apply them as a combined **Style & Architecture Guide**.
Order of precedence: **Principles**, **TypeScript**, **Naming & Formatting**, **Tooling**, **React**, **Routing & Structure**, **Components & UI**, **State Management**, **Styling & Theming**, **Accessibility & i18n**, **Testing**, **Docs & Comments**.

- Rules are **prescriptive** (must/should) and **concise**
- Wording is **imperative** and consistent: start bullets with **Use/Prefer/Avoid/Ensure/Keep/Provide/Implement**
- When a rule conflicts with another, follow the order of precedence above

Additional topics:

- **Security & Secrets** (`13-security-and-secrets.md`)
- **Data Fetching** (`14-data-fetching.md`)
- **Browsers & Responsiveness** (`15-browsers-and-responsiveness.md`)
