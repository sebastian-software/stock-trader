# Project Rules â€” Index

Order of precedence: **Principles**, **TypeScript**, **Naming & Formatting**, **Tooling**, **React**, **Routing & Structure**, **Components & UI**, **State Management**, **Styling & Theming**, **Accessibility & i18n**, **Testing**, **Docs & Comments**.

- Rules are **prescriptive** (must/should) and **concise**.
