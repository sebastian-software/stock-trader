# Monorepo

- Use **pnpm workspaces** with **Turborepo** as the task executor
- Keep larger shared configurations in **separate packages** (Prettier/Vite/tsconfig/storybook) and link them to apps and other projects
- Prefer **pipeline caching** and task dependency graphs to speed up CI and local builds
